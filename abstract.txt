Text classification is an important part of Natural Language Processing(NLP). Various
models, including traditional machine learning methods and new deep learning methods, have
been discovered to help people speed up development in NLP both in research and industry.
In this report, such models were applied to music’s genre classification based on lyrics and
generate prediction results. We analyze performance based on accuracy, model complexity,
fitting time. The result showed randomforest had the best performance in accuracy, around
63%, but not in fitting time and model complexity, SVM balanced accuracy, and fitting time.
Deep learning methods didn’t reach an expected outcome, accuracy reached around 50%. The
analysis has its limitation due to limited computational power and time.
